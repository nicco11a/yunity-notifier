# yunity-notifier
A project around the Yunity platform for sharing stuff (food), but it was missing a way to notify when a pickup is needed.

I am using the Yunity platform's API in order to notify the users when a pickup is ready:

https://foodsaving.world/api/
https://project.yunity.org/
https://github.com/yunity

Why not put it into there github repository? The code is still tied to Solidarity Fridge (solikyl.se) and in a very early stage of development.
